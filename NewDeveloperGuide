This guide is a work in progress and will be substantially improved as the project grows.


Step 1:
Cloning the project.  Using intelliJ IDEA, import project from Version control.
The project will be downloaded via Git and shortly after, the Gradle wrapper will initiate a Gradle build

Step 2:
Create Gradle run configuration (game)
name (suggested): runGame
tasks: clean assemble :javagachigame:run

Step 3:
Create Gradle run configuration (server)
name (suggested): runServer
tasks: clean assemble :javagachiserver:bootJar
 

You are now able to build and run both the client and the server
